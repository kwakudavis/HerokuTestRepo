##Notes

##Resource represents objects the API can deal with (response or request)  eg students, items can be resources, they can be mapped into database tables

#User class is a helper class for the UserRegister Resource because the api does not interact directly with it.

#User.py is a model, our internal represenentation of objects





##Simplifies the resource manipulation process


##Every resource has to be a class


##Test-First design - starting of by stating what your api is going to request| all itmes, specific items by name or by id |

##Flask restful allows you to return dictionaries without using jsonify

##tHE most popular http  status code is 200 not 404

##201 IS FOR CREATED

##202 IS FOR WHEN YOU ARE CREATING THE OBJECT WITHIN AFTER A MOMENT AND NOT INSTANTLY

##Filter is more efficient than iterating 

##FLASK JWT is needed for authentication, where JWT stands for Json web token thus encrypting data


##Secret key is going to contain the key


##jwt = JWT(app, authenticate, identity) jwt creates a new endpoint thus /auth and sends it a username and password to the authenticate function, a jwt token is created which is sent during the next request

#Folders in python are mostly reffered to as packages.__init__.py is within folders to show that it can look inside it for python files.. wihtout --init__ they are just folders
